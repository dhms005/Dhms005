# Android Multiple Contacts Picker Library
This is simple contact picker with possibility to pick multiple contacts. 
You can specify at the beginning if all contacts should be checked or not.

Initially I also added search feature - but I disable it due to poor performance. 
Feel free to fix it - you need to comment only one line of code to turn on this feature. 

This project uses ActionBarSherlock - BTW very nice library

You can freely use this library in all of your projects.
